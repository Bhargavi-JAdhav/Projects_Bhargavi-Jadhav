In safety-critical industrial machinery, bearing faults are a leading cause of mechanical failures, resulting in downtime, reduced productivity, and potential hazards. Early detection of bearing faults, along with severity assessment, is essential for implementing predictive maintenance strategies.
Traditional methods are often inadequate in identifying early-stage faults or quantifying severity. Hence, a data-driven approach using machine learning is required to enhance and automate the diagnosis
